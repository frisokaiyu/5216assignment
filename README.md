## Instructions of how to get access to my project files.
### 1. I uploaded all files about my 5216 assignment on my Github repository, and the website is [Zhiliang's 5216assignment](https://github.com/frisokaiyu/5216assignment);
### 2. Two methods to get my files online:
- 1) To use command line ('Zsh' or 'Terminal') to download all files in github. "git clone https://github.com/frisokaiyu/5216assignment". If you do not know how to use git commands, you can follow the tutorial of [Gitbook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/);
- 2) To copy "https://github.com/frisokaiyu/5216assignment" in your web browser, and click download button and save it in your computer;
### 3. I have created four folders whose names are "Assignment report", "Introduction vedio", "Presentation notes", "Quiz Game-final edition".
### 4. Enter into each folder, and you can get what you want.
### 5. If you want to run my project on your computer, the only thing you have to do is use my Podfile to install Facebook framework. I have finished Podfile in my project, you could use command line tools to enter into my root directory and type 'pod install' to install everything.
### 6. After all preparation finished, double click 'Quiz Game.xcworkspace' but do not double click 'Quiz Game.xcodeproj' mistakenly.
